# Augmented-Reality-using-Planar-Homographies

implementing an AR application step by step using planar
homographies. Before we step into the implementation, we will walk you through the theory of planar homographies. In the programming section, you will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography you will then warp images and finally implement your own AR applications.
